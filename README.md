Playing with triangles and whatnot.

## Useful Commands

- `npm i` to install dependencies
- `npm run start` to start the development server
- `npm run test` to run unit tests
- `npm run build` to compile to a production-ready bundle
- `npm start:production` to build, and serve production-ready bundle. This should be called once deployed to production.
